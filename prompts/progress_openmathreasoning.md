# OpenMathReasoning Environment Implementation Journal

## Day 1: Initial Setup and Environment Creation

### Understanding the Task
- Reviewed the specification in `atropos/prompts/spec_openmathreasoning.md`
- The goal is to adapt the GSM8k environment to work with the OpenMathReasoning dataset
- Main differences between datasets:
  - GSM8k: Simpler math problems with numerical answers
  - OpenMathReasoning: Complex mathematical problems with LaTeX notation
  - Field naming differences: `question`→`problem`, `answer`→`expected_answer`
  - OpenMathReasoning includes additional metadata like `problem_source`, `generation_model`

### Steps Taken
- Examined existing GSM8k environment implementation in `atropos/environments/gsm8k_server.py`
- Created `open_math_reasoning_server.py` based on the GSM8k implementation with key modifications:
  - Updated class names to `OpenMathReasoningEnv` and `OpenMathReasoningRow`
  - Modified the system prompt to include guidance for advanced mathematical notation and LaTeX
  - Updated dataset loading to use the "open-math-reasoning" dataset
  - Adjusted field mappings from `question` to `problem` and `answer` to `expected_answer`
  - Preserved additional metadata fields like `problem_type` and `problem_source`
  - Modified the gold answer parsing to handle the OpenMathReasoning format
- Created configuration file `atropos/environments/configs/open_math_reasoning.yaml`

### Implementation Details
1. **System Prompt Modification**:
   - Added guidance for LaTeX notation: "You should use proper LaTeX notation when writing mathematical expressions and formulas. For example, use \\frac{a}{b} for fractions, \\sqrt{x} for square roots, and ^ for exponents."
   - Kept the thinking structure with `<think>` tags
   - Maintained the boxed answer format: `\\boxed{your answer here}`

2. **Dataset Configuration**:
   - Updated dataset loading to use "open-math-reasoning" instead of "gsm8k"
   - Mapped field names appropriately: `problem` and `expected_answer`
   - Added handling for additional metadata fields

3. **Reward Function Enhancement**:
   - Modified the gold answer parsing to directly use the `expected_answer` field without additional processing
   - Maintained the same verification logic using the `verify` function

## Task Checklist Status
