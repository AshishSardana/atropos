<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>

Let's carefully analyze the problem step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells.</li>
<li>1 dozen = 12</li>
<li>
<p>2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 seashells</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of shells Kyle found = 2 * 24 = 48</p>

<li>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.</p>
</li>
<li>Number of shells Leigh has = (1/3) * 48 = 16</li>

<p><think><br />
First, determine how many seashells Mimi picked up. She picked up 2 dozen shells, which is (2 \times 12 = 24) shells.  </p>
<p>Next, Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So, Kyle's shells = (2 \times 24 = 48) shells.  </p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So, Leigh's shells = (\frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16).  </p>
<p>The question asks for how many shells Leigh had, which is 16.  </p>
<p>Everything checks out step by step.  </p>

<p><think><br />
Let's carefully work through the problem step-by-step.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells.</li>
<li>
<p>Since 1 dozen = 12, 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 seashells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi.</p>
</li>
<li>Mimi's shells = 24</li>
<li>
<p>Kyle's shells = 2 * 24 = 48</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.</p>
</li>
<li>Kyle's shells = 48</li>
<li>Leigh's shells = (1/3) * 48 = 16</li>
</ol>
<p>The question asks how many seashells Leigh had, which we have just calculated as 16.</p>
<p><think> <br />
The calculation appears straightforward: find Mimi's shells, then Kyle's, then take one-third of Kyle's shells for Leigh. The numbers check out logically and arithmetically.</p>
<p>Therefore, Leigh had \boxed{16} seashells.<br />

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Let's define variables for each type of pet:</p>

<li>Let ( C ) = number of cats</li>
<li>Let ( S ) = number of snakes</li>
<li>Let ( P ) = number of parrots</li>
<li>Let ( D ) = number of dogs (already given as 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Given information:</p>

<li>
<p>He has six more snakes than cats:<br />

</li>
<li>
<p>He has 2 dogs:<br />

<p>Total pets:</p>

<p>But we need an additional relation to find the actual number of cats and thus total pets.</p>
<p>The key piece of information is: "Six of his pets have four legs."</p>
<p>Which pets have four legs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Snakes: no legs</li>
<li>Parrots: no legs (or at least, bird legs are not counted as four-legged in this pet context)</li>

<p>So, the total number of 4-legged pets:</p>

<p>from the pets with 4 legs, and the problem says this total is 6:</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think> </p>
<p>Let's identify the variables for the number of each type of pet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let C = number of cats</li>
<li>Let S = number of snakes</li>
<li>Let P = number of parrots</li>
<li>Let D = number of dogs</li>
</ul>
<p>Given data:<br />
- Frankie's parents let him have many pets.<br />
- He has six more snakes than cats: S = C + 6<br />
- He has one less parrot than cats: P = C - 1<br />
- He has 2 dogs: D = 2<br />
- Six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Now, let's analyze the number of legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats have 4 legs each: 4 * C</li>
<li>Snakes have 0 legs: 0 * S</li>
<li>Parrots have 2 legs each: 2 * P</li>
<li>Dogs have 4 legs each: 4 * D</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of legs from all pets is:</p>
<p>Total legs = (4 * C) + (0 * S) + (2 * P) + (4 * D)</p>
<p>We are told that six of his pets have four legs. So:</p>
<p>Number of pets with four legs = 6</p>
<p>Let's see which pets have four legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs each</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs</li>
</ul>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:</p>
<p>Number of cats + number of dogs = 4 + 2 = 6</p>
<p>So, the total number of pets with four legs is 6, matching the given information.</p>
<p>This means:</p>
<p>C + D = 6</p>
<p>But D = 2, so:</p>
<p>C + 2 = 6</p>
<p>C = 4</p>
<p>From earlier:</p>
<p>S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10</p>
<p>P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3</p>
<p>Now, total pets:</p>
<p>Total pets = C + S + P + D</p>
<p>Total pets = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p>Check:</p>
<p>Total legs = (4 * 4) + (0 * 10) + (2 * 3) + (4 * 2)</p>
<p>= 16 + 0 + 6 + 8 = 30 legs</p>
<p>It matches the total count of pets with legs (6) and the total leg count is consistent.</p>

<p><think>Let's define variables for each type of pet:</p>

<li>Let ( s ) = number of snakes</li>
<li>Let ( p ) = number of parrots</li>

<p>From the problem, we know:</p>

<p>Total pets:<br />

<p>Additionally, six of his pets have four legs. Let's analyze the possible number of legs per pet type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs</li>
</ul>
<p>To get six pets with four legs, these could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>All cats and dogs (since both have 4 legs):</li>
</ul>
<p>Sum of legs from cats and dogs:<br />
  [<br />
  4c + 4d<br />
  ]</p>
<ul>
<li>Or some combination involving parrots and cats/dogs, but since parrots have 2 legs, they can't contribute to the "four-legged" count.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's think carefully:</p>
<ul>
<li>The six pets with four legs are likely cats and dogs because they have 4 legs each.</li>
<li>Snakes have zero legs, so they don't contribute.</li>
<li>Parrots have two legs, so they can't be counted towards the 6 with four legs unless some are parrots, which only have 2 legs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose:</p>
<p>Number of cats = ( c )</p>
<p>Number of dogs = 2 (given)</p>
<p>Number of parrots = ( p = c - 1 )</p>
<p>Number of snakes = ( s = c + 6 )</p>
<p>Number of pets with four legs:</p>

<p>But this has to equal 6:<br />

<p><think> <br />
Let's define variables for the different types of pets:<br />
- Let ( C ) = number of cats<br />
- Let ( S ) = number of snakes<br />
- Let ( P ) = number of parrots<br />
- Let ( D ) = number of dogs</p>
<p>From the problem:<br />
- Frankie has 6 more snakes than cats: ( S = C + 6 )<br />
- Frankie has one less parrot than cats: ( P = C - 1 )<br />
- He has 2 dogs: ( D = 2 )</p>
<p>Also, the total number of pets is:<br />
[<br />
\text{Total pets} = C + S + P + D<br />
]<br />
which simplifies to<br />
[<br />
C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2<br />
]<br />
Combine like terms:<br />
[<br />
C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2 = 3C + 7<br />
]</p>
<p>Next, the key information is: "Six of his pets have four legs." </p>
<p>Assuming the typical numbers of legs:<br />
- Cats, parrots, and dogs have 4 legs each<br />
- Snakes have 0 legs</p>
<p>Total legs from pets:<br />
[<br />
4 \times (\text{number of four-legged pets}) + 0 \times (\text{number of legless pets}) <br />
]<br />
which is<br />
[<br />
4 \times (C + P + D)<br />
]</p>
<p>But the problem states "Six of his pets have four legs," which suggests the total number of four-legged pets is 6.</p>
<p>Thus:<br />
[<br />
C + P + D = 6<br />
]<br />
Substitute the known values:<br />
[<br />
C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6<br />
]<br />
Simplify:<br />
[<br />
C + C - 1 + 2 = 6<br />
]<br />
[<br />
2C + 1 = 6<br />
]<br />
[<br />
2C = 5<br />
]<br />
[<br />
C = \frac{5}{2}<br />
]</p>
<p>This is not an integer, which is unlikely for pet counts. Maybe I made an assumption that the six pets with four legs are only cats, parrots, and dogs. But parrots have two legs, and snakes have zero legs.</p>
<p>Let's reevaluate the assumption: the phrase "Six of his pets have four legs" probably means the number of pets with four legs is 6. That aligns with counts for cats, parrots, and dogs, but parrots have two legs, so they probably don't contribute fully to the four-legged count.</p>
<p>Thus, for the "six pets with four legs" to be accurate, the total count of four-legged pets among cats, parrots, and dogs is 6.</p>
<p>Given that parrots only have 2 legs, the total number of four-legged pets among cats and dogs must be 6, because parrots can't contribute to that count.</p>
<p>So:<br />
[<br />
\text{Number of cats} + \text{number of dogs} = 6<br />
]<br />
which is:<br />
[<br />
C + D = 6<br />
]</p>
<p>We already know ( D = 2 ), so:</p>
<p>[<br />
C + 2 = 6<br />
\Rightarrow C = 4<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, as previously established:<br />
[<br />
S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10<br />
]<br />
[<br />
P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3<br />
]<br />
[<br />
D = 2<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, total pets:<br />
[<br />
C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19<br />
]</p>
<p>Total pets = 19.</p>
<p>Check: Count of four-legged pets:<br />
- Cats: 4<br />
- Dogs: 2<br />
- Parrots: 0 (since parrots only have 2 legs)<br />
- Snakes: 0</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets:<br />
[<br />
4 + 2 = 6<br />

which matches the given information.</p>

<li>Let ( D ) = number of dogs</li>
</ul>
<p>Given data:<br />
- Frankie's pets include cats, snakes, parrots, and dogs.<br />
- He has 6 more snakes than cats:<br />
  [<br />
  S = C + 6<br />
  ]<br />
- He has 1 less parrot than cats:<br />
  [<br />
  P = C - 1<br />
  ]<br />
- He has 2 dogs:<br />
  [<br />
  D = 2<br />
  ]</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
[<br />
T = C + S + P + D<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, there's an important piece of information: six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Let's analyze which pets have four legs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: 4 legs each</li>
<li>Snakes: 0 legs each</li>
<li>Parrots: 2 legs each</li>
<li>Dogs: 4 legs each</li>
</ul>
<p>The six pets with four legs are likely to be a combination of cats and dogs, since snakes and parrots don't typically have four legs. </p>
<p>So, the total number of pets with four legs:<br />
[<br />
\text{Number of 4-legged pets} = \text{cats} + \text{dogs} = C + 2<br />
]</p>
<p>Given that exactly six pets have four legs:<br />
[<br />
C + 2 = 6<br />
]<br />
[<br />
C = 4<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, with ( C = 4 ):</p>
<p>Find the number of snakes:<br />
[<br />
S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10<br />
]</p>
<p>Find the number of parrots:<br />
[<br />
P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3<br />
]</p>
<p>Number of dogs:<br />
[<br />
D = 2<br />
]</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
[<br />
T = C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19<br />
]</p>
<p><think>All the conditions check out:<br />
- 6 pets with four legs are the cats (4) plus the dogs (2): total 6.<br />
- All calculations are consistent with the given data.</p>
<p>Thus, Frankie has (\boxed{19}) pets in total.</think>&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Let's define variables for each type of pet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let ( C ) be the number of cats.</li>
<li>The number of snakes is 6 more than cats: ( S = C + 6 ).</li>
<li>The number of parrots is one less than cats: ( P = C - 1 ).</li>
<li>Dogs are given directly: ( D = 2 ).</li>
</ul>
<p>We are told that six of his pets have four legs. Typically, cats, dogs, and parrots have four legs. Snakes have no legs.</p>
<p>So, the pets with four legs are cats, dogs, and parrots. </p>
<p>The number of pets with four legs:<br />
- Cats: ( C )<br />
- Dogs: 2<br />
- Parrots: ( P = C - 1 )</p>
<p>Total pets with four legs:<br />
[ C + 2 + (C - 1) = 2C + 1 ]</p>
<p>The total number of pets is:<br />
[ T = C + S + P + D ]<br />
Plug in the known expressions:<br />
[ T = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 ]<br />
Simplify:<br />
[ T = C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2 = 3C + 7 ]</p>
<p>Now, we know that six of the pets have four legs:<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
Solve for ( C ):<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C = 5 ]<br />
[ C = \frac{5}{2} ]<br />
This leads to a fractional number of cats, which isn't possible in a physical count.</p>
<p>Re-examining the problem, perhaps there's a different interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li>It says "Six of his pets have four legs." Could it be that among all his pets, only six have four legs? </li>
</ul>
<p>Given the total potential pets:<br />
Total pets:<br />
[ T = C + S + P + D ]<br />
Substitute ( S = C + 6 ), ( P = C - 1 ), and ( D=2 ):<br />
[ T = C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 = 3C + 7 ]</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:<br />
[ C + 2 + (C - 1) = 2C + 1 ]</p>
<p>Since only six pets have four legs:<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C = 5 ]<br />
again fractional.</p>
<p>Is there an alternative? </p>
<p>Perhaps the phrase "Six of his pets have four legs" indicates that exactly six pets with four legs exist, and that number is 6. Our previous algebra suggests that the total species counts lead to a fractional count.</p>
<p>Possibility: Maybe the animals are only cats, dogs, and parrots with four legs, and snakes have none.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>Number of animals with four legs:<br />
[ C + 2 + P =? ]<br />
From earlier:<br />
[ P = C - 1 ]<br />
Thus:<br />
[ C + 2 + (C - 1) = 2C + 1 ]</p>
<p>Total with four legs:<br />
[ 2C + 1 ]</p>
<p>Given that only six pets have four legs, then:<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C = 5 ]<br />
which is fractional again, impossible in counts.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the "six of his pets have four legs" refers to the total pet count with four legs, and the <em>total</em> number of such pets is six, i.e.,<br />
[ \text{Number of four-legged pets} = 6 ]</p>
<p>So, the total of cats + parrots + dogs = 6:<br />
[ C + P + 2 = 6 ]<br />
Recall:<br />
[ P = C - 1 ]<br />
Plug in:<br />
[ C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C = 5 ]<br />
Again fractional. Impossible.</p>
<p>Now, consider that perhaps only six pets with four legs exist; that is, these six are among the total pets, which could be more than six.</p>
<p>From the previous:<br />
Total number of four-legged pets:<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C = 5 ]<br />
This cannot be.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the problem could be a trick: It says "Six of his pets have four legs" — perhaps that is simply stating that 6 pets are four-legged, and no contradictions exist if C, P, D are integers.</p>
<p>Suppose ( C = 2 ), then:</p>
<ul>
<li>( P = 2 - 1 = 1 )</li>
<li>( S = 2 + 6 = 8 )</li>
<li>( D = 2 )</li>
</ul>
<p>Check total four-legged pets:<br />
Cats: 2, Parrots: 1, Dogs: 2<br />
Sum: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5</p>
<p>It's fewer than 6, so we need one more four-legged pet from the snakes? No, snakes don't have legs. So total four-legged pets: 5, but the problem states six. So need one more four-legged pet — but that would come from a different category? No, the only options are cats, parrots, dogs (all four-legged). With C=2, total four-legged pets: 5.</p>
<p>Next, try C=3:</p>
<ul>
<li>( P=2 )</li>
<li>( S=9 )</li>
<li>( D=2 )</li>
</ul>
<p>Total four-legged pets:<br />
C: 3, P: 2, D: 2 = 3 + 2 + 2=7, which exceeds 6.</p>
<p>Try C=2.5? Not acceptable, as pets are discrete.</p>
<p>Try C=2.</p>
<p>Sum:<br />
- Cats: 2<br />
- Parrots: 1<br />
- Dogs: 2<br />
Total four-legged pets: 5</p>
<p>Close, but not enough.</p>
<p>C=3:<br />
- Cats: 3<br />
- Parrots: 2<br />
- Dogs: 2<br />
Total four-legged pets: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7</p>
<p>Too many.</p>
<p>C=2.666..., invalid.</p>
<p>It's clear that the only way for the total four-legged pets to be exactly six is if:</p>
<p>[ C + P + D = 6 ]<br />
[ C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C = 5 ]<br />
Again, fractional.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps the intended solution is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total four-legged pets: 6</li>
<li>These include cats, parrots, and dogs.</li>
<li>The total of cats + parrots + dogs = 6</li>
<li>We know ( D=2 ),</li>
<li>( P = C - 1 ),</li>
<li>total: ( C + P + D = 6 )<br />
Plugging in:<br />
[ C + (C - 1) + 2 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />
[ 2C = 5 ]<br />
Again fractional.</li>
</ul>
<p>But pet counts are discrete, so perhaps the only conclusion is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set ( C=2 )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>( P=1 )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>( D=2 )</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sum of four-legged pets:<br />
[ 2 + 1 + 2=5 ] (less than 6)</p>
<p>So perhaps the only acceptable counts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>( C=3 )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>( P=2 )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>( D=2 )</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sum: 3 + 2 + 2=7, which exceeds six.</p>
<p>Given all attempts, the only plausible consistent counts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>( C=2 )</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets: cats, snakes, parrots, dogs:</p>
<p>[ T = C + S + P + D ]<br />
[ S=C+6=8 ]<br />
[ P=C-1=1 ]<br />
[ D=2 ]<br />
Total:<br />
[ 2 + 8 + 1 + 2=13 ]</p>
<p>Check number of four-legged pets:<br />
[ C + P + D = 2 + 1 + 2=5 ]</p>
<p>But the problem says 6 have four legs, so we are off by one. Possibly, there's an implicit assumption that snakes are non-legged, so the only four-legged pets are cats, parrots, dogs, totaling potentially 5.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the "six" animals with four legs is the total number of pets with four legs, including cats, parrots, and dogs only, and the count is 6.</p>
<p>If we set ( C=3 ):</p>
<ul>
<li>( P=2 ),</li>
<li>( D=2 ),</li>
<li>total four-legged pets: ( 3+2+2=7 ), which is too high.</li>
</ul>
<p>If ( C=2 ):</p>
<ul>
<li>( P=1 ),</li>
<li>( D=2 ),</li>
<li>total four-legged pets: ( 2+1+2=5 ), less than 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, choosing ( C=4 ):</p>
<ul>
<li>( P=3 ),</li>
<li>( D=2 ),</li>
<li>total four-legged pets: 4+3+2=9 &gt;6.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the best fit is when ( C=3 ):</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets = 7, close to six.</p>
<p>Given the inconsistencies, perhaps the initial assumption is that there are 6 pets with four legs, and the overall total pets sum to:</p>
<p>Total:<br />
[ T = C + (C+6) + (C-1) + 2 = 3C + 7 ]</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets:<br />
[ C + (C-1) + 2 = 2C + 1 ]</p>
<p>Set equal to 6:<br />
[ 2C + 1 = 6 ]<br />

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Let's define variables for each type of pet:<br />
- ( C ) = number of cats<br />
- ( S ) = number of snakes<br />
- ( P ) = number of parrots<br />
- ( D ) = number of dogs<br />
- ( T ) = total number of pets</p>
<p>Given:<br />
1. Frankie has six more snakes than cats: ( S = C + 6 )<br />
2. He has one less parrot than cats: ( P = C - 1 )<br />
3. He has 2 dogs: ( D = 2 )<br />
4. Six pets have four legs.</p>
<p>Now, consider the number of legs for each type:<br />
- Cats: 4 legs each<br />
- Snakes: 0 legs each<br />
- Parrots: 2 legs each<br />
- Dogs: 4 legs each</p>
<p>Total legs contributed by all pets:<br />
[<br />
4C + 0 \cdot S + 2P + 4D<br />
]</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
[<br />
T = C + S + P + D<br />
]</p>
<p>From the problem, 6 pets have four legs. Let's see how many legs are contributed by each type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: ( 4C )</li>
<li>Snakes: ( 0 )</li>
<li>Parrots: ( 2P )</li>
<li>Dogs: ( 4D )</li>
</ul>
<p>Total legs:<br />
[<br />
4C + 0 + 2P + 4 \times 2 = 4C + 2P + 8<br />
]</p>
<p>Since six pets have four legs, the sum of cats and dogs (both with 4 legs) must be exactly 6:<br />
[<br />
C + D = 6<br />
]</p>
<p>Given ( D=2 ):<br />
[<br />
C + 2 = 6 \Rightarrow C=4<br />
]</p>
<p>Now, find all variables:<br />
- ( C = 4 )<br />
- ( S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 )<br />
- ( P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 )<br />
- ( D = 2 )</p>
<p>Total pets:<br />
[<br />
T = C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19<br />
]</p>
<p>Check total legs:<br />
[<br />
4 \times 4 + 0 + 2 \times 3 + 4 \times 2 = 16 + 0 + 6 + 8 = 30<br />
]</p>
<p>The total number of pets is <strong>19</strong>.</p>
<p><think> All conditions are satisfied:<br />
- Snakes: 10 (more than cats by 6)<br />
- Parrots: 3 (less than cats by 1)<br />
